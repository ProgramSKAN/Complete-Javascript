//BROWSER STORAGE
// 1.localstorage,sessionstorage > 
    // simple key-value store,
    // used to manage user preferences or basic user data,
    // can only be cleared ny user and vis JS only,
    // easy to use,vesatilse,bad for complex data(eg:google sheets)


//2.cookies
    //same as localstorage,sessionstorage with some config options
    //a big clunky to use,versatile(can set expiry dates),sent to server,bad for complex data
    //can read by http server as they are attached to http requests in the headers

//3.indexedDB
    //client side database
    //manage complex data
    //can be cleared by user via JS
    //bit clunky,great for complex (non critical) data,good performance
